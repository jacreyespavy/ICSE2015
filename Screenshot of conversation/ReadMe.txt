This package contains some screenshots to demonstrate how we interact with LLM tools.
You can find the corresponding prompt in the code by using the file name.
For example, the file named "prompt_2_2(SESSION claude2 Q1 2.0)(0.770).jpg" corresponds our second repeat experiment, where we input the full text of the SESSION paper and interacting with Claude2 using Q1. The corresponding insight-enhanced prompt is indexed as "prompt_2_2".Its overall accuracy on the SOF-1_test.csv is 0.770.


To streamline the discussion, we have omitted the discussion on insight_Q1 in the paper.
insight_Q2 is referred to as the Generic Insight-Digesting Prompt (GIDP) in the paper.
insight_Q3 is referred to as the Specialized Insight-Digesting Prompt (SIDP) in the paper.
insight_Q1 is a simpler/more basic generic prompt compared to GIDP, and its comparative meaning can be fully assumed by the GIDP as currently presented in the paper.
