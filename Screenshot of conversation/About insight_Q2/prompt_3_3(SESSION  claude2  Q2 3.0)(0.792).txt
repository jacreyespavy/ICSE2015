Q：According to the given paper, what are the differences in sentiment expression in software engineering texts? Please answer within 50 words.

A:According to the paper, software engineering texts tend to express fewer sentiments compared to social texts. When expressing sentiments, software engineering texts are more indirect and dispersed, with sentiments interspersed within longer, more complicated sentences used to describe technical issues. The paper argues these differences make sentiment analysis more challenging for software engineering texts.


Q：According to the given paper, how to handle such software engineering texts when analyzing sentiment ? Please answer within 100 words.

A:The paper proposes an approach called SESSION to improve sentiment analysis on software engineering texts. SESSION has three main steps. First, it preprocesses the text to filter out technical words and segments the text into clauses using natural language processing tools. Second, SESSION applies "filter rules" based on sentence structures to identify clauses that are likely expressing sentiment and filter out the rest. These rules look for sentiment indicators like exclamation marks, emojis, or adverbs decorating sentiment words. Third, SESSION applies "adjust rules" to enhance the sentiment analysis on the identified sentimental clauses. These adjust rules handle issues like conditional clauses, polysemous words, and negations. Overall, SESSION aims to handle the indirect and dispersed nature of sentiment expression in software engineering texts by using the unique sentence structures to filter out neutral clauses and adjust the analysis of sentimental clauses. Evaluation shows SESSION improves performance over baselines. The paper argues that the sentence structure better captures how sentiments are expressed in software engineering texts.
