Q:Paper Insight:
Software engineering texts tend to contain more technical descriptive text and less direct sentiment expression compared to texts from social media. Descriptive text details issues encountered during software development, while sentiment expressive text conveys the author's feelings about those issues. Distinguishing between these types of text allows sentiment analysis to focus on the expressive parts and avoid mislabeling neutral descriptive text, improving accuracy.
Here proposes using sentence structures to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering texts. It first preprocesses the texts to filter out code snippets and other technical elements. Then it defines filter rules to identify sentences that are likely expressing sentiment - such as containing exclamation marks, sentimental words, or first-person judgments. Sentences not matching these expressive patterns are ignored as likely neutral descriptive text. For the identified expressive sentences, adjust rules are used to handle issues like subjunctive clauses, polysemous words, and negations to better capture the expressed sentiment. By leveraging these linguistic structures rather than just keywords, the approach aims to improve accuracy in sentiment analysis for software engineering over neutral technical text.
I have a above paper insight about sentiment analysis for software engineering. Here, a new paper offers additional strategies on the same topic. I seek help to merge insights from both to refine my guidance on the task. Please give me a merged insight:


Aï¼šHere is a merged insight on sentiment analysis for software engineering texts, incorporating key points from both papers:
Software engineering texts tend to be more technical and descriptive rather than directly expressing sentiment. They often detail issues encountered during development, while sentiment is conveyed about those issues. Accurately analyzing sentiment requires distinguishing descriptive statements from sentiment expressions to avoid mislabeling neutral technical details as negative.
Both papers propose using linguistic structures to identify sentiment-expressive sentences and filter out descriptive statements. Rules can spot sentences with exclamation marks, sentimental words, or first-person judgments as likely expressing opinions. Sentences not matching these expressive patterns can be treated as neutral descriptions and excluded from sentiment analysis.
For the identified sentiment-expressive sentences, additional adjust rules help handle elements like subjunctive clauses, ambiguous words with multiple meanings, and negations. These aim to better capture the actual sentiment being expressed given the technical software engineering context. The papers demonstrate that leveraging both filter and adjust rules based on linguistic patterns improves accuracy over just applying sentiment lexicons to all text.
The integrated guidance is to preprocess software engineering texts to remove technical elements, then apply filter rules to distinguish sentiment-expressive sentences from neutral technical descriptions. Only analyze sentiment on the expressive sentences, using adjust rules to interpret them appropriately. This linguistic structure-based approach outperforms blanket sentiment analysis that fails to exclude descriptive statements.
