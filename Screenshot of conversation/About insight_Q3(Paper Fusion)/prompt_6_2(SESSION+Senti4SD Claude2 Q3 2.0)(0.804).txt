Based on the papers, we should distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering texts for sentiment analysis because:

Technical descriptive text tends to use domain-specific terminology and discuss software issues in a factual, neutral manner. This text is often misclassified as negative sentiment by off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools. In contrast, sentiment expressive text directly conveys the author's opinions, emotions, or attitudes. This text better reflects the actual sentiment. By distinguishing between these two types of text, we can filter out the misleading technical descriptions and better identify the segments that genuinely express sentiment. This allows sentiment analysis systems customized for software engineering domains to achieve higher accuracy.

Here is a more detailed summary within 200 words:

The papers propose several ways to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text for sentiment analysis on software engineering texts:

Use features based on sentence structures - Sentiment expressive texts often contain certain structures indicating subjectivity, like sentences starting with "I" or containing sentiment words decorated by intensifiers. Technical texts lack these subjective structures. Rules can be defined to identify sentiment sentences based on such syntactic features.
Calculate sentiment density - Sentiment expressive texts have a higher density of sentiment words than technical texts which focus more on descriptions. By calculating the ratio of sentiment words to total words, texts with higher sentiment densities are more likely to express emotions.
Build separate classifiers - A classifier can be trained on technical texts to recognize descriptive statements, while another classifier handles sentiment detection. Their outputs can be compared to determine whether a text segment conveys factual descriptions or subjective sentiments.
Learn word embeddings - Word vectors capture semantics and reveal usage patterns. Words used differently in technical vs. sentiment contexts will occupy distinct vector spaces. Their similarity scores to domain-specific prototypes can indicate whether they reflect technical terminology or subjective utterances.
In summary, by exploiting sentence structures, calculating text statistics, training customized classifiers, and learning semantic representations, we can effectively distinguish the descriptive and affective nature of texts to improve sentiment analysis performance for software engineering.
