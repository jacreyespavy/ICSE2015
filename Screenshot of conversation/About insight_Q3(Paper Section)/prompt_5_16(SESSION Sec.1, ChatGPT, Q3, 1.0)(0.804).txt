Q：According to the given description, why should we distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts? Please answer within 50 words.

A:Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in sentiment analysis for software engineering is crucial because SE texts often involve detailed issue descriptions. Focusing on sentiment-expressive clauses improves analysis accuracy, as sentiments are often indirectly expressed, intertwined with technical details, requiring a nuanced understanding of sentence structures.

Q：According to the given description, how to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts? Please answer within 100 words.

A:To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in sentiment analysis for software engineering, the proposed approach, SESSION, relies on observing sentence structures. It preprocesses and segments SE texts into clauses, filtering out non-sentimental clauses based on proposed rules. The complexity of software tasks often leads authors to describe issues in detail before expressing sentiments. SESSION utilizes heuristics to identify clauses likely to convey sentiments, ignoring those primarily serving technical descriptions. This approach recognizes that sentiments in SE texts are dispersed and indirect, enhancing the accuracy of sentiment analysis by focusing on specific sentence structures indicative of emotional expression in the context of software development.
