Q：According to the given description, why should we distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts? Please answer within 50 words.

A:We should distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering texts because the technical details are often not directly related to sentiment. Sentiment is usually expressed separately from technical descriptions. Trying to analyze sentiment on purely technical text would lead to inaccurate results.

A:Here is a 94-word answer on how to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts:

The passage states that sentiment expression in software engineering texts tends to be more indirect and dispersed compared to common social media texts. It observes that authors often have to describe technical issues in detail before or after expressing sentiment. Therefore, we can leverage sentence structures to help distinguish technical descriptive clauses from possibly sentimental ones. For example, we can ignore subjunctive clauses that describe hypothetical scenarios rather than express opinions. We can also distinguish meaning based on context - a word like "failure" could be technical when describing a system crash but sentimental when expressing frustration. Overall, by parsing sentence structures and noting contextual cues, we can better separate technical descriptive text from sentiment expressive text.
