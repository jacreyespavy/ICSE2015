Q：According to the given description, why should we distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts? Please answer within 50 words.

A:We should distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts because technical text tends to be more objective and factual, while sentiment expressive text reveals the author's subjective opinions and emotions. Distinguishing between them allows us to focus the sentiment analysis on the relevant expressive parts and avoid being misled by neutral technical descriptions.

Q：According to the given description, how to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts? Please answer within 100 words.

A:To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts, the paper proposes using filter rules to identify sentences that are likely expressing sentiment. These rules look for indications of direct sentiment like exclamation points, decorated sentiment like adverbs emphasizing sentiment words, first-person sentiment using "I" and "me", and making judgements. Sentences not matching these expressive patterns are filtered out as more neutral, technical descriptive text. Additional adjust rules then process the sentiment expressing text to handle things like subjunctive text, polysemous words, and negations to further refine the analysis. By filtering and adjusting based on these linguistic rules, the analysis can focus on the relevant sentiment expressive parts of the software engineering text.
