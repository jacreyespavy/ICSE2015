Q：According to the given description, why should we distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts? Please answer within 50 words.

A:Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering analysis is crucial because SE texts often use complex structures, indirect expressions, and contain fewer sentiments. Failure to make this distinction may lead to unreliable results with off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools built on social texts, necessitating specialized tools for accurate sentiment analysis in the software engineering domain.

Q：According to the given description, how to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment for software engineering texts? Please answer within 100 words.

A:To distinguish between technical descriptive and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the proposed approach involves three steps. First, preprocessing and segmentation using Stanford CoreNLP filter out technical terms and utilize POS tagging for sentence structure. Second, filter rules identify patterns indicative of sentiment expression, considering elements like exclamation marks, emojis, and specific sentence structures. Third, adjust rules refine sentiment analysis based on sentence structures, recognizing subjunctive mood, handling polysemous words, and addressing negations more effectively. This systematic process enhances sentiment analysis in software engineering texts, accounting for their unique characteristics, such as complex structures, indirect expressions, and lower sentiment density.
