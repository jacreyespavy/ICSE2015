A:Here is a 147-word summary of how the paper proposes to analyze sentiment for software engineering texts:

The paper proposes an approach called SESSION that uses sentence structure to improve sentiment analysis of software engineering (SE) texts. It first preprocesses the SE text and segments it into clauses using Stanford CoreNLP. It then applies filter rules to identify clauses that are likely expressing sentiment based on patterns like containing interjections or sentimental words. Clauses that do not match these expressive patterns are ignored. Next, it applies adjust rules that use sentence structure to enhance the sentiment scores output by the dictionary-based tool SentiStrength. For example, it identifies subjunctive clauses that express hypotheses not real sentiments, or distinguishes the meaning of ambiguous sentiment words based on context. By exploiting sentence structure to filter irrelevant clauses and adjust sentiment scores, SESSION is able to better analyze the more indirect and dispersed way sentiments are expressed in SE texts compared to social media. Experiments on four SE text datasets show SESSION outperforms baseline dictionary-based and learning-based sentiment analysis tools.
