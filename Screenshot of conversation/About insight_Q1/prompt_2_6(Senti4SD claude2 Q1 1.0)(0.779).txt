A:Here is a 150-word summary of how the paper analyzes sentiment for software engineering texts:

The paper presents Senti4SD, a sentiment analysis classifier specifically designed for analyzing sentiment in software engineering texts like Stack Overflow posts. Senti4SD was trained and evaluated on a manually annotated gold standard dataset of over 4000 Stack Overflow questions, answers, and comments that were labeled for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The classifier uses a combination of lexicon-based features that rely on prior sentiment scores of words, keyword-based features like n-grams and emoticons, and semantic features that capture similarity between vector representations of texts and sentiment prototype vectors in a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM). The DSM was built by running word2vec on a corpus of over 20 million Stack Overflow posts to better capture software engineering language. Evaluation shows Senti4SD improves on baseline tools like SentiStrength that are not customized for software engineering, reducing negative bias and misclassifications of neutral technical posts. The gold standard dataset and tools like Senti4SD provide new capabilities for analyzing sentiment and emotions in software engineering repositories.
